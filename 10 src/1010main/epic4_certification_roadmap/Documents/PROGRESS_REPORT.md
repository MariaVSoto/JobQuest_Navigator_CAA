# Epic 4 Progress Report

## Migration and Integration Summary

**Date:** [Fill in date of this report]

### 1. Node.js/TypeScript to Django Migration
- Completely removed all Node.js, Express, and TypeScript code from Epic 4.
- Deleted all related files and dependencies (`api/`, `dist/`, `node_modules/`, `package.json`, etc.).
- Rebuilt the backend using Django and Python, with all logic now in Django apps (`certification_roadmap/`, `skill_analysis/`).

### 2. Integration with Epic 1 Database
- Connected Django backend to the shared MySQL database used by Epic 1.
- Jobs are now imported from Adzuna into MySQL using Epic 1 scripts.
- Epic 4 fetches job descriptions directly from the MySQL `jobs` table for skill extraction and roadmap generation.

### 3. Certification Data Handling
- Certification data is still in JSON for now, but a migration script (`migrate_certifications_to_mysql.py`) is provided to move certifications into MySQL for production use.
- Skill extraction and certification matching are now fully Python-based (spaCy + custom logic).

### 4. API and Documentation
- The main API endpoint is now `/api/roadmap/for-job` (Django).
- All documentation has been updated and moved to the `Documents/` folder.
- Added a comprehensive setup guide for teammates (`SETUP_FOR_TEAMMATES.md`).
- Updated Swagger/OpenAPI spec to reflect the Django API.

### 5. Clean-up and Best Practices
- All obsolete files, folders, and legacy code have been removed.
- The project is now Django-only, with a clean structure and clear documentation.

**Next Steps:**
- Optionally, migrate certifications to MySQL and update backend to use DB for certs.
- Continue to refine skill extraction and certification filtering as needed.
