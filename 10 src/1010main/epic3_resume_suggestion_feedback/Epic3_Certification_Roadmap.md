# Epic 3: Resume Alteration Suggestion with Feedback Loops

## Overview
This epic focuses on continuously improving resume quality through AI suggestions and user feedback. The system provides actionable, dynamic suggestions for resume improvement and learns from user feedback to enhance the AI model over time.

## Microservices Architecture

### 1. Resume Suggestion Service (Core)
**Responsibilities:**

- Analyzes job descriptions and resume content
- Generates specific, actionable recommendations
- Updates suggestions dynamically based on job requirements

**Key Features:**
- AI-powered resume analysis
- Dynamic suggestion generation
- Keyword optimization
- Format and content recommendations

**API Endpoints:**
- POST /api/suggestions/analyze - Analyze resume against job description
- GET /api/suggestions/{resumeId} - Get suggestions for a specific resume
- POST /api/suggestions/feedback - Submit feedback on suggestions

### 2. Feedback Collection Service
**Responsibilities:**
- Collects and processes user feedback on suggestions
- Tracks user actions (accept/reject/modify)
- Maintains feedback history
- Prepares data for AI model training

**Key Features:**
- Feedback collection and storage
- User action tracking
- Feedback analysis
- Data preparation for model training

**API Endpoints:**
- POST /api/feedback - Submit feedback on suggestions
- GET /api/feedback/history - Get feedback history
- POST /api/feedback/analyze - Analyze feedback patterns

### 3. AI Model Training Service
**Responsibilities:**
- Processes feedback data
- Updates AI models based on user feedback
- Monitors model performance
- Manages model versions

**Key Features:**
- Model retraining pipeline
- Performance monitoring
- Version control
- A/B testing support

**API Endpoints:**
- POST /api/model/train - Trigger model retraining
- GET /api/model/performance - Get model performance metrics
- POST /api/model/deploy - Deploy new model version

## Database Schema

### Suggestions Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE suggestions (
    id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    resume_id VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
    job_id VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
    suggestion_type ENUM('keyword', 'format', 'content') NOT NULL,
    suggestion_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    confidence_score FLOAT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (resume_id) REFERENCES resumes(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (job_id) REFERENCES jobs(id)
);
```

### Feedback Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE feedback (
    id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    suggestion_id VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
    user_id VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
    action ENUM('accept', 'reject', 'modify') NOT NULL,
    feedback_text TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (suggestion_id) REFERENCES suggestions(id)
);
```

### Model Versions Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE model_versions (
    id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    version_number VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    performance_metrics JSON,
    deployed_at TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Integration Points

### Internal Integrations
1. Resume Management Service
   - Fetches resume content for analysis
   - Updates resumes based on accepted suggestions

2. Job Data Service
   - Retrieves job descriptions for comparison
   - Updates job requirements data

3. User Profile Service
   - Gets user preferences and history
   - Updates user profile with feedback data

### External Integrations
1. AI/ML Services
   - Integration with OpenAI or similar for text analysis
   - Model training and deployment services

2. Job Market Data
   - Integration with job market APIs for keyword analysis
   - Industry trend data for better suggestions
