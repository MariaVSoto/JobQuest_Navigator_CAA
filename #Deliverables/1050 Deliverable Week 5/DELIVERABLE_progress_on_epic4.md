# üöÄ Progress on Epic 4: Certification Roadmap & Skill Gap Analysis

**Sprint:** Epic 4: Certification Roadmap
**Team Member:** Ishan

## 1. Automation Tools Used & How They Were Applied

- **spaCy (Python NLP):**
  - Used for AI-powered skill extraction from resume text. The Python script (`extract_skills.py`) processes user input and returns a filtered, accurate list of skills.
- **Node.js/TypeScript Backend:**
  - Orchestrates the workflow, calls the Python script, and maps extracted skills to certifications using a local JSON map.
- **Git & GitHub:**
  - For version control, code review, and collaboration. All changes are committed and pushed to the `dev` branch.
- **Jira:**
  - For sprint/task management and tracking progress.
- **PowerShell/Terminal Automation:**
  - Used for running, testing, and deploying the backend and Python services.
